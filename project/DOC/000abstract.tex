It is natural to expect performing data mining in RDBMS, where data stored.
Can we perform graph mining directly in database, without moving data all round?
Can we implement various graph query methods via SQL, so as to leverage the powerful support from RDBMS?
Can we figure out a maverick graph, which has unusual features among a similar set of graph datasets?
In this project, our goal is to implement a SQL version of graph mining algorithms, and perform broad spectrum graph mining on a variety of graph dataset with the support of RDBMS.
