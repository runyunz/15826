In this report, we studied how to perform graphing mining in RDBMS.
Implementating graph queries using SQL has the following advantages:
\bit
\item it avoids the extra effort of extracting data and performing analysis elsewhere
\item it makes full use of the support of RDBMS(e.g. JOIN operations, data management, query optimization, etc.)
\eit
After performing graph mining on various large-scale dataset, we come to the conclusions: 
\bit
\item real world large graph data are skewed distributed, and thus power lawer distribution are applied at many places
\item large graph in information technology area such as graph social network and web graph behave very differently from real work network like road network in terms of small diameter
